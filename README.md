# Weather API Demo
### By: Jacob Sleeba

This project demonstrates how to connect to a real web API using JavaScript, fetch JSON data, and display it on a webpage.  
The API used is the **OpenWeatherMap Current Weather API**, which requires a valid API key.

## Project Description
This simple web application allows a user to type the name of any city and retrieve:

- Current temperature (°C)
- Weather condition description
- Humidity level
- Wind speed
- City name returned by the API

It uses the `fetch()` method in JavaScript to make an HTTP request to OpenWeatherMap’s API.
